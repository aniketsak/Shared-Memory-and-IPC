Running the Application:

To run the application proceed with the following steps:
1) Open terminal and do make clean; make
2) Make sure that there no message queues and shared memory copies which are not in use ; using ipcs command
   If any, delete them using the ipcrm command
3) Run the server program as a daemon by providing two arguments, the first argument being the number of segments and the second being the segment size
4) After running the server, run the userapp application providing file name(s) as an argument(s)

Notes:
For ease of checking we have defined a variable in userapp.c  called 'k'. If k is 0, synchronous function will be called and if k is 1, asynchronous function will be called. The value of k is obtained at run-time using scanf function.

If you want to use the library in a different program, make sure the make file is edited to add the program to be compiled
